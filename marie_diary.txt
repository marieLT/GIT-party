Dear diary,

today I went to work, but I ended up hiding in a corner and texting for a long time because my job is pretty lame. Afterwards, I went to the gym and pumped some massive iron to fulfil my dream of one day becoming the most jacked lolita of all time. I then bought some lip balm and headed home, where I remain. 

Sincerely,
Marie
